    <p>Maurice Slade has one main hobby. That hobby is boxing, as a sport.  “I have been boxing since the age of 18 when I no longer needed parental acceptance of me doing this sport. As a kid I played team sports, football being the main one. As a boxer I competed in USA sanctioned matches, as an amateur I finished my ranking at rank number 6 in the nation at 168 pounds. After and during my years of competing I had been teaching boxing, and that is where my passion is these days.” You can find Maurice Slade teaching out of his own studio called Rough House Boxing.
